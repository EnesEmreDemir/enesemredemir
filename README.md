### Hi there 👋, I'm Enes
#### Software Developer and Game Enthusiast 
 
I'm a computer engineering student whose passionate about developing software, I devote much of my free time to developing software and exploring software technologies. 

I am currently working on backend development. 

I am a big fanatic of C programming language and assembly therefore most of my projects is written with C. (Unless it is web project)

Video games always been my passion and therefore I develop games and plugins/mods for games. 

I’m a free software enthusiast (as per Free Software Foundation definition of “free”).
