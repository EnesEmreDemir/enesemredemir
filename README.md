### Hi there 👋, I'm Enes
#### Software Engineer and Game Enthusiast 
 
I'm a computer engineering student whose passionate about developing software, I devote much of my free time to developing software and exploring software technologies. I am currently studying backend web development. I prefer using technologies such as golang and .NET. I enjoy programming with low level programming languages such as C/C++ and assembly. So as a hobby, I develop low level applications including embedded systems and games but not limited to. I’m a free software enthusiast (as per Free Software Foundation definition of “free”).
