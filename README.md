### Hi there 👋, I'm Enes
#### Software Engineer and Game Enthusiast 
 I'm a computer engineering student whose passionate about developing software, I devote much of my free time to developing software and exploring software technologies. I am currently working on back end development & DevOps and because I'm a huge game enthusiast I am also working on game development & graphics development as a hobby. I’m a free software enthusiast (as per Free Software Foundation definition of “free”). 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my website: enesemredemir.github.io 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Banging your head against a wall for one hour burns 150 calories.
