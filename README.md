### Hi there 👋, I'm Enes
#### Software Engineer and Game Enthusiast 
 
 I'm a computer engineering student whose passionate about developing software, I devote much of my free time to developing software and exploring software technologies.
I love programming with low level programming languages and working with hardware. I develop many things that can be programmable with low level programming languages especially embedded systems but not limited to. Other than low level programming I also develop backend web applications.
I’m a free software enthusiast (as per Free Software Foundation definition of “free”). 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on embedded systems.
